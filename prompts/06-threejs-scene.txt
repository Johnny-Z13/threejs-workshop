create me a threejs scene with the loaded pirate character
  I want this to have an orbit camera and then I want buttons to switch between the different animation
  states.
  Make sure that this is touch control friendly.
  LMB / Single Touch - Rotate
  Scroll wheel / Pinch to zoom - Zoom
  RMB / Two fingers - Pan
   Use $threejs-capacitor-ios  to make sure it can be deployed on mobile.
